# My_Portfolio
This is a summary of my portfolio. I have completed some interesting projects, mostly utilising Python for machine learning models and data analysis. 

In my portfolio, I have focused on four primary projects that are:
1) DATA SCIENCE PROJECT
2) UBER DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT
3) DANY DINER CASE STUDY
4) UNDERSTANDING DATA

I have completed preprocessing, data cleaning, and machine learning model-based data analysis for each of these projects, and I have developed a solution. In addition to these projects, I have completed several Tableau visualisation projects. All of those dashboards are available in my Tableau public account also you can find those in my portfolio; these perceptive dashboards illustrate the messages that the data is attempting to convey to us.
